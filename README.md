## General Info and Motivation

This app was created to practice using APIs, handling user input and API responses, and writing asynchronous code in JavaScript.

## How to Use

- Access the app [here](https://andreww-00.github.io/Weather-App/)!
- Use the search bar in the top right to search for your location.
- The weather for today and a three-day forecast will be displayed on the page.
- Toggle between °F and °C using the slider in the top right corner.

## What I Learned

- How to interpret API documentation to retrieve specific data from the API response.
- How to leverage user inputs to fetch information using an API.
- The process of creating and managing API keys.
- Crafting mobile-responsive interfaces for content that loads asynchronously.
- Implementation of asynchronous functions and error handling techniques.

## Improvements

- Display an error message on the screen instead of just logging it in the console when API data retrieval fails.
- Utilize browser geolocation to automatically display the user's current location.
- Add a loading symbol to indicate when asynchronous functions are in progress.
